#Repository for 100 Days of Code Progress
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code progress repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my coding journey over the next 100 days. I'll be focusing on various projects, coding exercises, and personal challenges to enhance my skills and knowledge in programming.

##Overview
The main purpose of this repository is to keep a record of my daily coding progress. Each day, I will be adding code files, updates, and notes to showcase the work I've accomplished. Whether it's solving algorithmic problems, building projects, or exploring new technologies, you'll find it all here.

##Folder Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders (e.g., day-1, day-2) where I'll be storing the code files and related materials for that specific day. Inside each day's folder, you can find a variety of code files and any additional resources or notes.

##Daily Updates
I will update the README.md file inside each daily folder to provide insights into the work accomplished on that specific day. This may include summaries of problems solved, progress on projects, challenges faced, and any key takeaways.

##Projects and Challenges
In addition to coding exercises, I'll be working on various projects and challenges throughout the 100 days. These may range from building small applications to exploring new technologies and frameworks.

##Additional Notes
Feel free to explore the repository and check out my coding journey. I appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or insights you may have to offer. Let's learn and grow together through this coding adventure!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
